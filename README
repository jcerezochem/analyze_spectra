analyze_spectra
==================

Python tools to analyze UV and IR spectra from Gaussian log files

Tools provided:

 * analyze_UVspectra.py: convolute spectrum and optionally show the plot 
                         for (basic) analysis

 * analyze_UVspectra_pyqt5.py: open a Qt5 GUI for more refined analysis

 * analyze_IRspectra.py: convolute spectrum and optionally show the plot
                         for (basic) analysis

 * analyze_IRspectra_pyqt5.py: open a Qt5 GUI for more refined analysis
